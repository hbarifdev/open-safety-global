        Data on rebreather accidents is needed by all involved with rebreathers, for developing safety cases and for business assessment.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">BEFORE YOU SET OUT TO GO DIVING:</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Choose your rebreather with care. Different rebreathers and the same dive may bring an entirely different risk. Product designs (if non-reputable the brand) harm lives. Unused rebreathers stored on shelves for years also carry risks. Only CE marked or otherwise tested by reputable agencies should be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always pre-dive your rebreather with a full off-checklist; and look where that checklist came from.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change your sorbent within the manufacturer's stated endurance for the dive profile you plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always replace your CO2 cells after a year of service or within 9 months after manufacture â€“ whichever comes first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do pre-breathe checks and remove the rebreather that fails any check or that you have any doubt about.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">WHEN YOU PRE-BREATHE WITH ELECTRONIC CCR</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Look at your PPO2 at entry minute on initial descent.</li>
        <li>Look at your PPO2 every 5 minutes on bottom time.</li>
        <li>If manual mCCR, add O2 to match setpoint PPO2s.</li>
        <li>If you feel sleepy or confused, or concerned, immediately inject a burst of O2.</li>
        <li>Immediately abort the dive for any CO2 problem.</li>
        <li>If one diver aborts a dive, for any reason, the buddy MUST stay with them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">IF REBREATHER SHOWS AN ALARM OR MALFUNCTIONS:</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Inject some gas (O2 if manual). Then think.</li>
        <li>Process with logic. If warning is faulty: bailout. If you suspect hypercapnia: bailout and flush air.</li>
        <li>Do NOT inhale.</li>
        <li>Do NOT continue dive without injecting gas manually.</li>
        <li>If time elapsed is bad, or if you do not know your PPO2, then you must bail out immediately.</li>
      </ul>
